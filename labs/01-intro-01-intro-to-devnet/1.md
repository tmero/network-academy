## How to Join the DevNet Community

### About DevNet
DevNet is Cisco’s resource and professional community for network engineers and application software developers working with Cisco APIs and platforms.  Joining the community is free of charge and carries no requirements or obligations.  And what you get is pretty awesome.  Like the ability to follow and participate in technical support forums where you can get answers quickly to questions from fellow community members who may be a few steps further along the same path that you are on.  Plus, you’ll be able to create your own DevNet profile, so you can receive information about events and opportunities specific to your area of interest.  There’s more of course, but let’s get started…

### Step 1:
Go to [https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/overview](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/overview) and complete the steps to becoming a DevNet member.  You’ll be asked to create a Cisco ID first.  If you already have a Cisco ID, you can go directly to Step 2 to create your DevNet account.<br/><br/>

### Find your area of interest on DevNet
DevNet has information, tools and services for a wide range of Cisco technologies, ranging from SDN and network programming to Data Center, Cloud, Collaboration, Security, and IoT.

### Step 1:
Go to the [DevNet home page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/home/index.gsp).  Click on “Technologies” in the top navigation.  Use the left hand navigation in the pull down mega menu to explore the many Cisco technologies for which tools and learning tracks are available to you.

### Step 2:
Select “Networking” from the left side mega menu, then click on “Go to the Dev Center.”  Here you can explore and learn about Cisco DNA (Digital Network Architecture) building blocks and programmable interfaces.<br/><br/>

### Step 3:
Click the Cisco DevNet logo in the upper left corner to return to the DevNet homepage.  Then return to the “Technologies” menu from the top navigation to explore the tools and learning tracks in other Cisco technologies.  (Hint: you can take a shortcut to a Dev Center page by clicking on the color icons under the homepage main banner.)<br/><br/>

**Dive deeper. Explore the documents, downloads, learnings, videos for one of the APIs**
There are hundreds of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) available via DevNet.  APIs open up new opportunities for coders to create network aware applications, and network engineers to set policy for those applications in the network.   In this learning lab we’ll take a look at just one of those APIs – APIC-EM –  so you can see the scope of learning tools available.  APIC-EM is an SDN controller for policy based automation of the network infrastructure, simplifying deployment and network operations. All the capabilities are exposed via a REST API.

### Step 1:
Go to the [DevNet home page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/home/index.gsp).  Click on “Technologies” in the top navigation.  Using the left hand navigation in the pull down mega menu, select “Networking” from the left side mega menu, find APIC-EM in the menu and click on it.

### Step 2:
Welcome to the APIC-EM site on DevNet.  In the upper right navigation, click on “Docs.”<br/><br/>
![](/posts/files/01-intro-01-intro-to-devnet/assets/images/docs.png)<br/><br/>
In the left hand navigation on the Docs page you’ll find Guides, Reference Docs, Downloads, and Resources that will help you learn more about APIC-EM.  There are also video tutorials for you to watch.

### Step 3:
Click on the "Learn" in the upper right hand navigation.<br/><br/>
![](/posts/files/01-intro-01-intro-to-devnet/assets/images/learn.png)<br/><br/>
Here you’ll find labs that will help you learn how to automate and simplify network operations by using Python to implement the APIC-EM policy based controller REST API.  Feeling adventurous…give one of the modules a try.  Or keep going to the next step.

**Finding Cisco DevNet events near you**

DevNet participates in and sponsors events around the world.  Some are live, some virtual.  Some are huge, like our DevNet Zones at Cisco Live.  Some are small meet-ups.  DevNet provides you with opportunities to find and attend coding camps, hackathons, workshops, and conferences to further develop your skills, make professional connections, and grow your career.

### Step 1:
From the [DevNet home page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/home/index.gsp).  Click on “Discover” in the top navigation.  This will open the Discover mega menu.  In the mega menu, right column under “Connect,” click on “Events”.<br/><br/>

**Exploring DevNet Learning Tracks**

Learning Tracks provide a guided path to learn selected Cisco technologies.  Based on DevNet Learning Labs, a track is made up of modules, which in turn are composed of learning labs.  Some modules also focus on general knowledge in programming, networking, and related topics.### Step 1:
From the [DevNet home page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/home/index.gsp).  Click on “Discover” in the top navigation.  This will open the Discover mega menu.  In the mega menu, left hand column under “Learn,” click on “Learning Tracks.”

### Step 2:
Browse the many different Learning Tracks on the page.  Click on any track to further explore the modules and labs in each track.

**DevNet Developer Sandbox**

Whether you want to be a coder yourself or work on the IT operation/DevOps side of the business, you’ll either be working with code, or working with coders.  Either way, you need to know about code.  You’ve seen where DevNet provides learning labs and events to help you learn about code.  DevNet also provides live sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com) to help you get started with Cisco APIs, and development lab environments called “Sandboxes” for integrating and testing code with live, hosted infrastructure.

### Step 1:
From the [DevNet home page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/home/index.gsp).   Click on “Discover” in the top navigation.  This will open the Discover mega menu.  In the mega menu, second column under “Code,” click on “Sandbox Remote Labs".
